# Readme Impact Analysis

## Overview

This project explores the role of `README.md` files in the success of GitHub
repositories. The analysis focuses on understanding whether repositories with
proper documentation (README.md) demonstrate higher visibility and engagement
compared to those without documentation.

The study is conducted as an **undergraduate research-oriented project** and
uses publicly available GitHub repository metadata.

## Research Questions

### Main Research Question

1. Do GitHub projects with `README.md` files show higher success metrics
   (such as stars and forks) compared to those without `README.md` files?

### Future Research Questions

2. Is the presence of `README.md` associated with project completion or
   long-term maintenance?
3. Do repositories with consistently maintained `README.md` files outperform
   poorly documented repositories over time?

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a public dataset containing GitHub repository metadata:

- **Dataset Source:**  
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/donbarbos/github-repos

This dataset includes information such as repository stars, forks, and other
basic attributes. The dataset is filtered and analyzed within Google Colab.

## Project Status

This is an **ongoing research project**.  
The analysis is exploratory in nature and may evolve with additional datasets,
methods, or refined research questions.

Results and interpretations may change as the project progresses.
